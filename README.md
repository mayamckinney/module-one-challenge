# Module One Project

## Horiseon Accesibility Fix

This code was provided to our bootcamp class to clean the provided code for a website to be optimized with search engines and follow accessibility standards. In order to do so, the HTML and CSS was reworked in order to be easier for other programmers to read and understand better whatâ€™s going on in this homepage.

## What was added?


Semantic HTML
Alt attributes
A title
Re-named elements
Shifting of the code in order to follow a more logical order
Comments to HTML & CSS

The website will still visually look the same, however, the code was completely reworked.
